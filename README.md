# DL-Project-Produce-Classifier-Using-CNN--
This project trains a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of fruits and vegetables. The model has several convolutional and pooling layers, followed by dense layers. It uses data augmentation, and after training, it predicts and displays the class of a sample image along with the accuracy.
